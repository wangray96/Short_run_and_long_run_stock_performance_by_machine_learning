# Short_run_and_long_run_stock_performance_by_machine_learning

論文摘要：
In an era characterized by an explosion of data, enhanced computational power, and advanced algorithmic innovations, machine learning technology has experienced rapid development,demonstrating unique strengths in processing complex datasets. This study applies three machine learning models-Random Forest, Principal Component Regression, and Neural Networks to predict stock returns. Using a moving window method, we analyzed extensive data spanning several decades.Our results show that PCR excels in 1-month return predictions and forms high-return portfolios, while RF demonstrates remarkable stability and the lowest RMSE for medium to long-run predictions. NN5performs well in short-run prediction but lacks consistency across periods. These findings highlight the strengths of each model and their potential in optimizing investment strategies, emphasizing the importance of model selection based on prediction periods.
